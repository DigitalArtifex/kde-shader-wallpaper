I'll probably maintain it on Github principally for issues/PR but I'll try my best to maintain both, if anything contact me on twitter [@y4my4my4m](https://twitter.com/@y4my4my4m).

Roadmap:
- [x] Version 1.0 - Simply load shaders
- [x] Version 1.1 - File Dialog added
- [x] Version 1.2 - iGPU fix
- [x] Version 1.3 - 70 new shaders + autolisting(current version)
- [ ] Version 2.0 - Customize shaders via GUI
- [ ] Version 3.0 - Directly load shaders from shadertoy.com or file

Notes:
- Performance may vary depending of your specs, but it's actually not all that resource intensive, depends on the shader too.
- This requires 3D Acceleration in order to work. If you are running this in a virtual machine make sure you enable it.
